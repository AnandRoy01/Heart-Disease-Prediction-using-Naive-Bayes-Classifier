# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Implementation of naive bayes classifier in detecting the presence of heart disease using the records of previous patients.

Naive bayes classifier implemented from scratch without the use of any standard library and evaluation on the dataset available from UCI. Comparison of this model is made with Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier of sklearn library. I have used 5 random partitions of training and testing dataset to evaluate the implementation and results are given for each partition.

Dataset for evaluating Na√Øve Bayes classifier: Heart Disease Data Set, available from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

As the calssifier is taking random partitions for 5 different times, random results would be predicted with average accuracy being around 50.00 %.
